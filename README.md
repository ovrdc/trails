# Trails Portal built with Jekyll

A website hosting bike trails, hiking trails and mountain bike trails for the southern Ohio region. Funded in part by the Ohio Department of Transportation, the Appalachian Regional Commission and OVRDC. This project uses Jekyll to build a searchable web portal with interactive maps for geographic data. This portal focuses on trails, but the project could be used for any type of geographic data. We make use of Jekyll Collections, defaults setup in the ``_config.yml`` file and the ``_data`` folder. The amazing thing about this site is that it is powered by one csv file and a series of templates.

## About the Jekyll New Age Theme
Jekyll New Age Theme originally based on [New Age bootstrap theme ](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/new-age/)

### Built by
[Antonio Trento](https://it.linkedin.com/in/antoniotrento)

This Jekyll template was created to develop, landing pages, squeeze pages, portfolio and blog or all the above.

### I integrated analytical tools and marketing such as:
- Google Ad Words
- Google analytics
- Disqus comment system
- Add This social sharing

>>External stylesheets and libraries included are Google Fonts, Font Awesome, Normalize.CSS, and WOW.js

In order to set your log data to applications _config.yml just open the file and find the associated items.

I also built a system to add their own names on the same company files

**To change the base colors yellow go in css folder there main.css where you can set the primary color and the secondary color, remember that the theme is gradient in the background areas**
